THEORY: Write a GitHub Actions workflow file to build a Docker image from a Dockerfile, run tests inside the container, and push the image to Docker Hub.

SOLUTION:          Workflow File:   # Use an official lightweight Python image
                                      FROM python:3.9-slim

                                    # Set the working directory
                                      WORKDIR /app

                                    # Copy the source code
                                      COPY . .

                                    # Run a simple command
                                      CMD ["echo", "Hello from Docker!"]
                 
                 Docker File:   name: Docker Build

                                 on: 
                                   push:
                                    branches:
                                     - main
                                   pull_request:
                                    branches:
                                     - main

                                 jobs:
                                   build:
                                     runs-on: ubuntu-latest

                                     steps:
                                       - name: Checkout repository
                                        uses: actions/checkout@v3

                                      - name: Set up Docker Build
                                       run: docker build -t my-docker-image .





LAB: Create a simple GitHub repository with a Dockerfile and the GitHub Actions workflow file. Trigger a workflow run and provide the workflow run ID.
