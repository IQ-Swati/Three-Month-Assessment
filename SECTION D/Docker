Docker:

THEORY: Write a Dockerfile for a Node.js application that installs dependencies, copies the application code, and starts the application using npm start.

SOLUTION:                  # Use official Node.js image as base
                             FROM node:18-alpine

                           # Set working directory inside container
                            WORKDIR /app

                           # Copy package.json and package-lock.json first (to leverage Docker cache)
                            COPY package*.json ./

                           # Install dependencies
                           RUN npm install

                           # Copy the application source code
                           COPY . .

                           # Expose port 3000
                            EXPOSE 3000

                           # Start the application
                            CMD ["npm", "start"]



LAB: Build and run the Docker image locally. Provide the Docker image ID and a screenshot of the running container.
