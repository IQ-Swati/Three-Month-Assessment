AWS:

THEORY: Explain how you would set up a highly available and scalable web application using AWS services. Include VPC, EC2, Load Balancer, Auto Scaling, and RDS in your explanation.


SOLUTION:    # Setup VPC:
             1. Login with AWS Credentials.
             2. Open the AWS Console.
             3. Search for VPC.
             4. Click on Your Create VPC.
             5. Enter name of the VPC.
             6. Enter IPv4 CIDR block range for VPC which is basically a VPC address range.
             7. Click on Create VPC.
             8. Afer creating VPC, we need to create the subnets in the VPC.
             9. Go to Subnet from left menu.
            10. Click on Create Subnet.
            11. Select VPC ID of the created VPC.
            12. Enter subnet name, availability zone, IPv4 CIDR block range of VPC, then subnet block range and click on Create subnet.

            In this way, Your VPC is Created Successfully.

          # Creating EC2:
          1. Navigate to EC2 Instance Page.
          2. Click on Launch Instance.
          3. Enter  the specific name of the Instance.
          4. Select the Machine Image (AMI), like Ubuntu.
          5. Select Architecture- 64-bit, Instance type- configurations.
          6. Create Key pair name for login, if exists then we dont need to create any key-pair.
          7. Select Network settings for EC2 instance.
          8. Check for other settings as per requirement, and click on Launch Instance.
          9. After instance is created, check for Public IP, and extract password from .pem file and you can login into instance successfully.

          In this way we have successfully created the EC2 machine.


         ==============================================================================================================================================

        # Creating RDS Instance-
        1. Open AWS Console.
        2. Go to AWS RDS.
        3. Click On Create Database.
        4. Select Database type - MySQL or Postgresql or any other.

        6. Enter Database name.
        7. Create master user and password.
        8. Choose Netwoking and other additional options.
        9. Create Database.
       10. Download application to access database.
       11. Go to database dashboard in AWS.
       12. Make note of endpoint & port.
       13. Check for the allowed IP in Security Groups.
       14. Go back to application such as DBeaver.
       15. Enter Endpoint of database, port, username and password, and you can use the database.

       In this we have successfully created the Database in AWS.



LAB: Create and configure an S3 bucket with public read access. Upload a file to the bucket and provide the URL for access.


SOLUTION:   I have created a S3 Bucket named "my-assessment-bucket-1" attached the pdf anf mentioned the public URL for access.
            Public URL: https://my-assessment-bucket-1.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/GENERATING+CSR.pdf
