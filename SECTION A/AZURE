THEORY: Describe the process of setting up a virtual network in Azure and connecting it to an on-premises network using a VPN Gateway.

SOLUTION:      Create virtual network gateway
                  |-- Create vnet (10.0.0.0/16)
                  |-- Create default subnet (10.0.0.0/24)
                  |-- Create gateway-subnet (10.0.1.0/28)
                  |-- Create Public IP
               Create local network gateway
                  |-- put public Ip address of your local system in local network gateway
                  |-- put private ip of your local device having 32 cidr (ipconfig)
               Create connections ( for connecting the Virtual network gateway and Local Network Gateway)
               Check the provisioning state of connections and virtual network gateway
               Create VM --> get the Public IP Address of VM 
               Connect with the rdp with public IP --> check with ip config




LAB: Create an Azure Virtual Machine (VM) using the Azure CLI. Ensure the VM has SSH access and install Apache on it.

SOLUTION:     I have created VM using CLI, provided the ssh access and installed appache server on it.
