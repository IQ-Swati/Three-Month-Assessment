Security:

THEORY: Explain the best practices for securing a cloud infrastructure. Focus on IAM policies, network security, and data protection.

SOLUTION:    Best Practices for Securing Cloud Infrastructure:
             1. Grant only the minimum permissions necessary for each user or service.
             2. Assign permissions based on roles (e.g., Developer, Admin) rather than individuals.
             3. Enable MFA to prevent unauthorization access.
             4. Enable cloud audit logs (Azure monitor)
             5. Use private and public subnets.
             6. Use bastion host or AVD for remote access.
             7. Keep all the keys or password in Secret Management Service (Azure Key Vault)
          
             


LAB: Configure a security group in AWS that only allows SSH and HTTP access. Provide the security group ID and its rules.

SOLUTION: Configured the SSH --> 22 and Http --> 80 access in AWS.
