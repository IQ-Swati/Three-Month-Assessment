Incident Response:

THEORY: Outline your approach to handling a critical incident in a production environment. Include steps for initial response, investigation, resolution, and post-incident review.

SOLUTION:          The process involves four stages:
                   1. Initial Response (Detect the issue)
                    --> Acknowledge the Incident (Azure alert tool)
                   2. Investigation
                    --> Gather logs and metrices (Application Insights)
                   3. Resolution
                    --> Find the root cause and resolve it.
                   4. Post-incident Review
                    --> Make a Cause-effect diagram with proper documentation for future use.


LAB: Simulate a simple incident (e.g., service down) and provide a step-by-step log of your incident response actions.
