Terraform:

THEORY: Write a Terraform script to deploy an EC2 instance in AWS with the following specifications: t2.micro, in the us-west-2 region, and with a specific security group allowing SSH access.

SOLUTION: Directory Structure: TERRAFORM-AWS
                               |-- modules
                                 |-- ec2
                                    |-- main.tf
                                    |-- variables.tf
                                    |-- outputs.tf
                                 |-- secuirty_group
                                    |-- main.tf
                                    |-- variables.tf
                                    |-- outputs.tf
                                 |-- main.tf
                                 |-- variables.tf
                                 |-- outputs.tf
          


LAB: Deploy the above Terraform script and provide the public IP of the EC2 instance.

SOLUTION: I have created a terraform code where i have created two modules: ec2 and security group also print the public ip in the main output folder.
